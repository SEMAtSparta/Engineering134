# README

This is a private repo which stores my project files during my training at Sparta Global.

## Week 1: Business Week	

This week has very little code inside it, but included are a practice Markdown file and a Powershell script.

The Powershell script takes an input.txt file and outputs the same text but translated into [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

### Known issues

- Does not work correctly with punctuation.

## Week 2: C# Core

This week begins the basics of C#. 

The first exercise was a basic "Hello World" application which prints the text "Hello World" 
and also demonstrates printing within a for-loop.
