# README

This is a private repo which stores my project files during my training at Sparta Global.

## Week 1: Business Week	

This week has very little code inside it, but included are a practice Markdown file and a Powershell script.

The Powershell script takes an input.txt file and outputs the same text but translated into [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

### Known issues

- Does not work correctly with punctuation.

## Week 2: C# Core

This week begins the basics of C#. 

Inside the Basics folder there are two applications:

1. The OperatorsApp was a basic exploration of operators and operator priority.
2. The ControlFlowApp has examples of various control flow statements, including
for, foreach, while and while-do loops.

Next was the tutorial on Unit Tests which are demonstrated inside the UnitTestLesson. 
In this tutorial we covered how to write tests in Visual Studio using NUnit. 
We also covered different kinds of programming errors, covering logical, syntactic and runtime.
We then covered how to write both individual [Test]s and [TestCase()]s.
We also briefly learned the naming convention for test functions, using the Gherkin scenario.

After the tutorial on Unit Tests I did the follow-up lab session, which is inside the Lab1 Folder.

next we made exceptions
